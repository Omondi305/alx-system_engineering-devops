First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status

In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

Create a database named tyrell_corp.
Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.

Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password you’d like.
replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.

What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost. That’s why you want to backup and store them in a different system in another physical location. This can be achieved by dumping your MySQL data, compressing them and storing them in a different data center.

Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.
